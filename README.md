> To all who took the survey: Thank you so much for your generousity and honesty. Your answers are helping and I promise to publish the results here soon.

## Background

#### Review Scope
Any framework or tool that
* Claims to aid in rapidly starting the development of **native Android applications written in Java**.

> For this requirement, different combinations of keywords such as *framework*, *bootstrap*, *template*, *base*, *architecture*, *generator* were used during the search phase

* Was updated during 2015/2016
* Has a license

#### Notable Exclusions
* Cross-Platform Frameworks
* Library projects limited to narrowly-scoped functions or application layer

#### Other Notes
* For open-source, [GitHub](https://github.com) was the main place for finding projects. [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) didn't retrun useful or relevant results while [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/) was more or less redirecting to the same GitHub results
* If similar projects (e.g. forked projects) were found only the latest one was included
* Proprietary projects weren't execluded but I found none that fit the scope. For better or worse, googling *android* and  *framework* returns mostly references to cross-platform frameworks
