# Android RAD Frameworks & Tools
This research is part of an effort to determine whether or not there's a need for better [RAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development) tools and frameworks for the Android Platform.

## Scope
Any Project with a framework or tools that
* Aids in rapidly starting the development of **native Android applications written in Java**
* Was updated during 2015/2016
* Has a license

> Cross-Platform Frameworks weren't included as they didn't fit the criteria



## General Notes
* For open-source, [Github](https://github.com) was the primary place of finding projects. [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) didn't retrun useful or relevant results [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/) was more or less redirecting to the same GitHub results
* If similar projects (e.g. forked projects) were found only the latest was included
* Included info are based on the project documentation, *not code examination*
* Proprietary projects aren't execluded but I found none that are fit the scope. For better or worse, googling "Android Framework" returns mostly results referring to cross-platform frameworks

## Something about a Survey for Android Developers?
Survey? What the..Oh *the* survey. Yes of course. It's **really important**. Just between you and me, this entire thing just a sham to get you to do it. ;b
